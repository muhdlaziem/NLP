As a Data Scientist expert specializing in unstructured data, you are given a task by your Project Manager to sift through a text file containing information of a group of residents in a village in Selangor who are eligible under the B40 category to receive free medical assistance. The criteria are as below:

1) Age >= 50 years 
23) Must be born in Selangor (with state code '10')

the code definition of a Malaysian identity card is YYMMDD-SC-XXXX where SC refers to the state code where the resident is born and YYMMDD (first 4 digits) refers to their date of birth.

Given the file residents.dat, use your knowledge in "regular expressions" to filter the document and extract only the following information:

1) The residents name who comply with all of the above criteria
2) The residents identification card no
3) The residents contact number
4) The residents household income

Print your output in an external file named "B40.dat" and indicate each type of info.  Sample output file shall look like the following (sample output):

Name of resident		ID Card No		Contact No	Household Income
MaimunahMat    			570824-10-5003 		60102355239	3990
Ibrahim				590212-10-5561		601112302487	2999
