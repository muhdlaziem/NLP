Ringgit to strengthen against US dollar.
The US dollar-Ringgit exchange rate is forming a death-cross pattern, which in the past has led to a decline in the currency pair, based on technical charts. 
Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that this death-cross pattern occurs when a 50-day moving average drops below the 100-day gauge. 
It said on the previous three occasions this move took place, the dollar posted additional losses of 3%, 3% and 7% before finding a bottom. 
The ringgit has underperformed Asian currencies since policy makers took steps in November to deter foreign banks from trading non-deliverable forwards, the wire report said.
At 1.45pm, the ringgit was trading at 4.4305 to the dollar from the previous close of 4.4312.
