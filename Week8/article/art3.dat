No survivors: Malaysian mixed doubles all out of Malaysia Open
National No 1 mixed doubles Chan Peng Soon-Goh Liu Ying were sent home early, after crashing out in the first round of the Malaysia Open on Wednesday.
The 2016 Rio Olympic Games silver medallists failed to retain their momentum after winning the first game 21-18 against Indonesian duo Edi Subaktiar-Gloria Emanuelle Widjaja, losing the remaining two sets 21-19, 21-17.
The defeat was the second major blow for the national camp, following the first round exit of former men's doubles world No 1 Goh V Shem-Tan Wee Kiong who went down 21-17, 23-21 to Or Chin Chung-Tang Chun Man of Hong Kong.
Two other pairs Hoo Pang Ron-Peck Yen Wei and Tan Kian Meng-Lai Pei Jing also failed to deliver, ending Malaysia's interest in the mixed doubles.
Pang Ron-Peck Wei lost 22-20, 21-16 to South Korea's Choi Solgyu-Chae Yoo Jung, while Kian Meng-Pei Jing succumbed 6-21, 21-19, 21-13 to Japan's Kenta Kazuno-Ayane Kurihara.
National No 3 Goh Soon Huat-Shevon Lai Jemie had conceded a walkover earlier after the former injured himself during training on Tuesday.
