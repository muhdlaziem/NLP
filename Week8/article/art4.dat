Ibrahimovic saves Man Utd, Leicester surge on.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic marked his return from suspension with a 94th-minute penalty to earn Manchester United a 1-1 draw against Everton at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
A deliberate handball by Ashley Williams, who was sent off, allowed Ibrahimovic to cancel out Phil Jagielkas opener and extend Uniteds unbeaten run in the Premier League to 20 matches.
But it remained an unwelcome result for Jose Mourinhos side, who have now drawn nine games at home this season and trail fourth-place Manchester City by four points.
Elsewhere, Leicester Citys resurgence under Craig Shakespeare continued as they beat bottom club Sunderland 2-0 to record a sixth successive win since the dismissal of manager Claudio Ranieri.
Ibrahimovics last-gasp spot-kick  his 27th goal of the season  meant United held on to fifth place, three points above Arsenal and Everton having played a game more than the former.
