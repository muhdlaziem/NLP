Royals join memorial service for London terror attack victims.
Prince William, his wife Kate and his brother Prince Harry spoke with survivors and the families of those killed in the terror attack outside the British parliament at a memorial service on Wednesday.
The royals joined those affected by the assault at a "Service of Hope" at Westminster Abbey, just across Parliament Square from the scene of the attack on March 22.
The assault killed four people, including a police officer guarding the gates of parliament.
Khalid Masood, a 52-year-old convert to Islam known to the security services, drove into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before stabbing policeman Keith Palmer to death. Masood was later shot and killed by officers in the parliaments forecourt.
Leslie Rhodes, 75, a retired window cleaner; Aysha Frade, 44, a school administrator; and Kurt Cochran, 54, an American tourist, were killed on the bridge.
