The politically sensitive trade gap with China narrowed sharply by 26.6 percent from January to $23 billion ahead of a summit between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping this week, although seasonal factors were likely behind the dramatic drop, economists said.
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade deficit declined 9.6 percent to $43.6 billion, also as exports increased to their highest level in more than two years, after rising to a near two-year high of $48.2 billion in January.
